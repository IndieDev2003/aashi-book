    content: `On 9 May 2023, our story began in the most unexpected way. I added you on Snapchat without thinking much of it, just like we often do with so many others. But little did I know, that simple action would be the start of something truly special. For weeks, we didn’t talk, and I wondered who this mysterious Aashi was. I would scroll through my list of friends and see your name, but no messages exchanged. It was like you were there, yet so far away. Looking back now, I realize that the best things often take time. Our connection didn’t begin immediately, but the seed had been planted, and soon, it would bloom into something beautiful.`,

    content: `It wasn’t until 7 July that everything started to change. I remember that day so clearly—it was the first time I noticed you opening my snaps. That simple act filled me with excitement and curiosity. It felt like a small, but significant step toward something I had been unknowingly waiting for. I gathered the courage to ask you to send me snaps, not knowing how you would respond. To my surprise, you did, and the first snap of your beautiful face arrived on 7 September. Seeing your face for the first time made everything real—it wasn’t just about snaps anymore; it was about the person behind them. It was the moment that brought us closer and marked the beginning of something truly special.`,

    content: `Your birthday on 18 September felt like a milestone for me. I was nervous but excited to wish you a happy birthday, hoping it would bring us even closer. When you responded warmly, I knew we were building something. But it wasn’t just about your birthday—on 11 December, when you wished me a happy birthday, it felt like a full circle. I wasn’t expecting you to remember, but the fact that you did meant the world to me. These moments, small yet meaningful, were the building blocks of our relationship. Each birthday wish carried more weight than words could describe, as it symbolized how much we were becoming a part of each other’s lives, step by step.`,

    content: `By January, our conversations had taken on a life of their own. We weren’t just casual Snapchat friends anymore; we were starting to share more of our lives. One day, I asked you if you could help me redesign my computer table. It was a playful request, but part of me hoped you would do it just to see more of your creativity. You didn’t get around to doing it, but that didn’t matter because by then, something far more important had been built between us—our bond. Then came 27 February, when you watched my Instagram story, and something clicked. We started talking like never before, moving beyond casual exchanges to real conversations that went deeper with every word.`,

    content: `March marked a turning point in our relationship. On 5 March, we had our first voice call on Telegram. I remember feeling so nervous but equally excited to finally hear your voice. As soon as we started talking, it felt like everything was right in the world. It wasn’t just about the words we spoke, but the comfort and warmth I felt hearing your voice for the first time. It felt like I had known you forever. Then, on 14 March, we took things a step further with our first video call. Seeing your face, hearing your laughter—it was a moment that solidified our connection. After that, we spent countless hours watching movies together, sharing little pieces of our lives, and growing closer with each passing day. `,

The moment you asked, I felt my heart overflow with joy. I didn’t need to think twice. I said yes, knowing that this was the beginning of a lifetime together. We had come so far in such a short amount of time, but every step felt like it was meant to be. From the first snap to the first call, to the proposal—everything led us here. You turned my world upside down in the best way possible, and now, I look forward to every moment we will share together as we continue this beautiful journey of love.`,
